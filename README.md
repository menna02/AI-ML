# *Welcome to My Data Science Journey Repository!*

This repository serves as a platform for sharing my assignments and hands-on projects as I progress on my journey towards becoming a proficient Data Scientist. Each folder in this repository represents a milestone in my learning process, starting from foundational Python skills, advancing through data science concepts, and currently focusing on various machine and deep learning models.

### Repository Structure:

Python: This section contains assignments and projects related to mastering Python programming.

Data Science: Explore my projects and exercises focusing on data analysis, visualization, and manipulation.

Machine Learning Models: Dive into my exploration of various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

Deep Learning: Completed projects and assignments that demonstrate my understanding of deep learning concepts and techniques.

Computer Vision: My latest module, where I am currently working on projects involving computer vision.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): My current module, focusing on projects and assignments involving natural language processing techniques and models.

MLOps: This section covers my exploration and understanding of MLOps practices, reflecting the importance of deploying the ML models with different GUI libraries like Stream-lit, Gradio. Also, deploying the ML in RESTful APIs using Flusk.


### Journey Completion:
My data science journey has peaked after completing all these modules, including MLOps. I am now focusing on preparing for interviews and working on a comprehensive project that consolidates and applies all the concepts I've learned. This project serves as a continuous practice to refine my skills and maintain a sharp edge in the ever-evolving field of data science.
