The file is too large to upload it here as I have used DataPrep library to explore and plot the data in the titanic dataset. 
To be able to run this notebook successfully, you need to use import this class file besides your notebook as I have used some methods from it. 

Note:
** I have made this class file to kinda automate the process of EDA. It contains methods to plot data columns with different data types, and also clean the data from nans, outliers, skewness, more over the columns encodings.
